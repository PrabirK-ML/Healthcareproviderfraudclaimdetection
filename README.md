# Healthcare provider fraud claim detection
This application can detect a fraud claim raised by a HealthCare provider.
From data preparation,Feature transform upto Model creation, I used google colab.
I used flask framework for accessing this application. This service can be accessed as an API. 

For a basic web view I used flassger.

One docker image is also created for making it easy deployable.
